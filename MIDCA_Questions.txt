1) In the .sim language, can you use logical connectives in operator conditions?
2) Similarly, can you create a predicate which is consists of a logical statement using other predicates?
3) Is it necessary to translate every environment into worldsim? (I don't think so)
4) Can you create new atoms, predicates, objects, operators, etc on the fly?
