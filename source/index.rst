Welcome to Rebel Agents's documentation!
========================================

This documentation should cover in depth the inner working of the rebel agent project codebase as it stands so far. The :ref:`user-guide` serves as an easy-to-read and approachable overview to the project, covering installation instructions, how to run demos, how to construct demos. The :ref:`progress-report` lays out how the project has changed over time, highlighting milestones and changes from version to version, as well future work. Finally, the :ref:`reference` section explains each class and method in the code itself for new researchers.
